    <h1>WS A Node.js WebSocket library</h1>
    <p>
        WS is a WebSockets server for Node.js. It's quite low level: you listen to incoming connection requests and
        respond to raw messages as either strings or byte buffers. Since WebSockets are natively supported in all modern
        browsers, it is possible to work with WS on the server and the browser's WebSocket API on the client.

        In order to demonstrate how to set up WebSockets with Node and WS, we have built a demo app which shares users'
        cursor positions in realtime. We walk through building it below.

        Building an interactive cursor position-sharing demo with WS
        This is a demo to create a colored cursor icon for every connected user. When they move their mouse around,
        their cursor icon moves on the screen and is also shown as moving on the screen of every connected user. This
        happens in realtime, as the mouse is being moved.</p>


    <script>
        const ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8080")

        ws.addEventListener('open', () => {
            console.log(" We are connected to webservers");
            ws.send("Hey, where are you going")

        })
        ws.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
            if (event.data instanceof Blob) {
                let reader = new FileReader();

                reader.onload = () => {
                    console.log("Result: " + reader.result);
                };

                reader.readAsText(event.data);
            } else {
                console.log("Result: " + event.data);
            }
        })
    </script>
